# Football-xG-Visualizer
This Streamlit app allows the user to generate key visuals for football (soccer) players or teams. All data is from [understat](https://understat.com) via web scraping and [understatapi](https://pypi.org/project/understatapi/). 

- I had to edit some of the understatapi files to be compatible with my Python version which is why it is in this repository. 

- [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-advanced-football-statistics-11cace1d863a) taught me how to webscrape the understat data.

-[This Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slehkyi/extended-football-stats-for-european-leagues-xg) defines some of the team statistics. 

Leagues supported: Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, and Ligue 1
