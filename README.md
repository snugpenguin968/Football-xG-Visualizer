# Football-xG-Visualizer
This Streamlit app allows the user to generate key visuals for football (soccer) players or teams. All data is from [understat](https://understat.com) via web scraping and [understatapi](https://pypi.org/project/understatapi/). I had to edit some of the understatapi files to be compatible with my Python version, which is why it is in this repository. 

Leagues supported: Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, and Ligue 1
